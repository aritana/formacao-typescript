#### Objectives:
- You may have heard that TypeScript is a superset (or superset) of the JavaScript language. But what does it mean? TypeScript (TS) manages to use the full context of JavaScript (JS) and adds advantages of its own, such as static typing and other language features that make the code less susceptible to errors during development and bugs. Thus, when using this language, your experience will be much more fluid and sophisticated.

- In this training we will see an overview of the use of TypeScript, progressively diving into the language, and showing the advantages and differences in relation to JavaScript, in addition to presenting the best practices for you to use TypeScript in your applications.
